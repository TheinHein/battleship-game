## Description
- This project is part of The Odin Project Self-learning Javascript Curriculum. 
- The main purpose of the project is to practice the basics of unit testing using Jest.
- During building this project, I have gain more practical knowledges about OOP and some design patterns by implementing publisher/subscriber pattern to control the game while manipulating the DOM.

- Some of the challenges, aside from learning Jest, included DOM manipulation, drag and drop ability to place ships onto the board, and making the game mobile-friendly.

## Features
- Interactive browser-based game which can also be played on small-screen devices.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Jest
- Webpack

## Todos
- Add Player vs Player option.
- Add drag and drop feature for touch-screen devices.
- Improve the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.
